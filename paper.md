## 1. Introduction
Vortex flow imaging has recently attracted much attention owing to a strong correlation between intraventricular flow pattern and heart function [1â€“3].

## 2. Methods
2.1. Problem Statement.

## 3. Results and Discussion
### 3.1. Forward Simulation of Blood Flow in LV
We perform the forward numerical simulation using the FSI model in COMSOL Multiphysics in order to obtain 3D synthetic flow data inside the moving LV domain.

Table 1 confirms that the proposed 3D model provides better reconstruction performance in terms of local and global errors of the velocity and vorticity fields.
