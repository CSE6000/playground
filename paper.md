Jaeseong Jang,1 Chi Young Ahn,2 Jung-Il Choi,1 and Jin Keun Seo1

## 1. Introduction
Vortex flow imaging has recently attracted much attention owing to a strong correlation between intraventricular flow pattern and heart function [1â€“3].

## 2. Methods
2.1. Problem Statement.

## 3. Results and Discussion
Thus, the pointwise errors at the local regions may not affect the major features of vortex flows. Furthermore, compared to the previous 2D reconstruction model [11], Table 1 confirms that the proposed 3D model provides better reconstruction performance in terms of local and global errors of the velocity and vorticity fields.
